Project 2 Accompanying Homework

1. Output produced would be on screen as shown: 
endlendl
endline
where, after the first line, there would be a ‘newline’ to switch to the 2nd line. 
2. This program produces a 45 degree tilted line of “#” mark, with number of len-1 space from 1st line to 0 space at the lenth line.
3. Modified code shown as follows:

	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
	    int len;

	    cout << "Enter a number: ";
	    cin >> len;

	    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	    {
		    int j(i);    
		    while (j < len)
		    {
		        cout << " ";
			j++;	
		    }
		    cout << "#" << endl;
	    }
	}


4. Modified code shown as follows:

	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
	    int len;

	    cout << "Enter a number: ";
	    cin >> len;

	    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	    {
		    int j(i);    
		    do
		    {
		        cout << " ";
			j++;	
		    }while (j < len);
		    cout << "#" << endl;
	    }
	}
5.	switch(weekday)
	{
		case 1:
		cout << "rainy days and mondays get me down";
		break;
		case 2:
		cout << "ruby tuesday";
		break;
		case 6:
		case 7:
		cout << "wonderful weekend";
		break;
		default:
		cout << "regular day";
	}
